The findings from this research allow us to evaluate the level of protection against CSRF attacks in OAuth 2.0 implementation in Android applications. This study aims to enhance user protection by identifying and discouraging the use of vulnerable Android applications employing OAuth 2.0 for social login. It emphasizes the importance of diligent implementation and robust security measures for developers utilizing OAuth 2.0. Additionally, our research demonstrates the potential for examining existing applications for security vulnerabilities and sets a precedent for future security audits in this domain.',
