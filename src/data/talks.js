        description: 'Oblivion Token is a focused offensive-research utility that makes Microsoft 365 Conditional Access Policy (CAP) bypass testing practical, repeatable, and scriptable. Designed for red-teamers and security researchers, it systematizes token-centric workflows and exercises policy edge cases to expose where device, network, or app-context assumptions fail including realistic test paths against Microsoft first-party (built-in) applications.',

        description: 'OAuth 2.0, commonly used for authorization, can be susceptible to CSRF attacks in Android applications. To address this, we developed an Android app to assess other apps\' use of the OAuth 2.0 state parameter—a key defense against CSRF. Our analysis, conducted on both Chrome and the default browser, evaluates whether Android apps using OAuth 2.0 are adequately protected against CSRF attacks. Our research aims to protect users by highlighting apps with potentially vulnerable OAuth 2.0 implementations.',

        description: 'An automated COVID-19 screening framework using chest X-ray images is proposed in this study. It leverages artificial intelligence techniques and transfer learning for accurate diagnosis. The framework extracts features using transfer learning and applies modified deep neural networks. Grad-CAM visualization supports the predicted diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to other deep learning techniques. This framework has the potential to aid in early COVID-19 diagnosis and alleviate the burden on radiologists.',
