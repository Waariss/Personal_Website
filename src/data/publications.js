        description: 'Poultry farming is crucial to the food chain, and chicken health directly impacts product quality and safety. Diagnosing poultry diseases using polymerase chain reaction is costly, particularly for small farms. To address this, we developed a mobile-based service for farmers, enabling the identification of common chicken diseases from fecal images via a Line account. Our system achieved 86.49% segmentation precision and 95.93% classification accuracy on a large dataset, offering a practical and accessible tool for local farmers.',

        description: 'OAuth 2.0, commonly used for authorization, can be susceptible to CSRF attacks in Android applications. To address this, we developed an Android app to assess other apps\' use of the OAuth 2.0 state parameter—a key defense against CSRF. Our analysis, conducted on both Chrome and the default browser, evaluates whether Android apps using OAuth 2.0 are adequately protected against CSRF attacks. Our research aims to protect users by highlighting apps with potentially vulnerable OAuth 2.0 implementations.',

        conference: 'InCIT 2022',
        venue: '6th International Conference on Information Technology',
        description: 'An automated COVID-19 screening framework using chest X-ray images is proposed in this study. It leverages artificial intelligence techniques and transfer learning for accurate diagnosis. The framework extracts features using transfer learning and applies modified deep neural networks. Grad-CAM visualization supports the predicted diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to other deep learning techniques. This framework has the potential to aid in early COVID-19 diagnosis and alleviate the burden on radiologists.',
